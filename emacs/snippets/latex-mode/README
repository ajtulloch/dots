--- Installation ---

In order to use these snippets you need to install Emacs, AucTeX,
RefTeX, and YASnippet. Once that is done installation is done by
simply copying the files .yas-parents, .yas-ignore-filenames-as-triggers,
.yas-parents, and the snippets into the 'snippets/latex-mode'
subdirectory within your YASnippet installation.

You can also use the installation script install.sh. The script takes 
a single argument which is the directory in which you have installed
yasnippet. 

If Emacs is running you need to issue the 'yas/reload-all' command in
order to load the snippets.
