;; #Pallet
;; 
;; Pallet is a package management tool for Emacs.
;; 
;; It uses @rejeep's excellent
;; [Cask](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el) as a platform to keep
;; track of your installed packages.
;; 
;; ##News
;; Pallet version 0.6 is now available. This version introduces some
;; breaking changes against previous versions, the most significant being
;; that Pallet will *only* work with Cask v0.6 or later.
;; 
;; ##Target platform
;; 
;; Pallet should work with Emacs 24 (including recent snapshots).
;; 
;; ##Use
;; Pallet has a very simple interface:
;; - `M-x pallet-init` creates a Cask file using information about
;;   installed packages from the package.el system
;; - `M-x pallet-install` installs packages listed in your Cask file
;; - `M-x pallet-update` updates installed packages
;; 
;; Pallet's main job, though, is to add and delete package references
;; from your Cask file as you install and delete them using the built-in
;; Emacs package management system. It does this automatically and silently.
;; 
;; ##Installation
;; 
;; To install Pallet, you should first install Cask, following the
;; instructions [here](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el). **At present,
;; just install Cask -- don't add anything to your .emacs or init.el file**.
;; 
;; After installing Cask, there are two ways you can go, depending on
;; your situation:
;; 
;; 1. **I have a working Emacs install, with packages already installed,
;;    and can access [MELPA](http://melpa.milbox.org).**
;; 
;;    In this case run `M-x list-packages`, and install Pallet.
;;    Then, run `M-x pallet-init`. Now you have a Cask file in your
;;    emacs.d directory which contains listings for all files you've
;;    previously installed via `package-install`, and your .emacs.d/elpa
;;    directory has been replicated under .emacs.d/.cask/.
;; 
;;    You can if you wish now delete your .emacs.d/elpa directory, and
;;    remove any lines from your init.el adding archives to
;;    `package-archive`, or running `package-initialize`.
;; 
;; 2. **I have a newly installed Emacs and/or am not set up to access
;;    MELPA.**
;; 
;;    In this case, create a file called `Cask` in your emacs.d
;;    directory. Add the following lines to it:
;; 
;;    ```lisp
;;    (source melpa)
;; 
;;    (depends-on "pallet")
;;    ```
;; 
;;    Then, in terminal and in your emacs.d directory, run
;; 
;;    ```
;;    cask install
;;    ```
;; 
;;    This will create a .cask directory inside your .emacs.d directory,
;;    initialize a package directory under .emacs.d/.cask/, and install
;;    Pallet to it.
;; 
;; **Finally, make sure the following lines are in your init.el, before any
;;   packages are required:**
;; 
;; ```lisp
;; (require 'cask "<path-to-cask>/cask.el")
;; (cask-initialize)
;; (require 'pallet)
;; ```
;; 
;; `<path-to-cask>` will vary depending on how you installed Cask: if you
;; installed via the `curl` method, it is likely to be `~/.cask`; if you
;; installed via Homebrew, it is likely to be `/usr/local/Cellar/cask/<version>`.
;; 
;; ##Contributing
;; Contributions to Pallet are very welcome.
;; 
;; Fork and clone the repo, then run `git
;; submodule update --init`, which will install
;; [el.mk](http://github.com/rdallasgray/el.mk).
;; 
;; Now, [install Cask](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el).
;; 
;; Then run `cask install`. You should now be able to run the tests using
;; `make test`.
;; 
;; Any new feature or bugfix should be covered by tests -- see the files
;; in /test for guidance on how to write your own. When you've
;; created your feature, make a pull request against master in this repo.
;;
;;; Code:

;; We need to get a copy of the package-archives alist
;; before requiring Cask, as doing so will empty the list.
